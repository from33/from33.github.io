											<h3>I love driving</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Since I received my driver's license at 18 years old, I rarely sat as a passenger anymore. Part of it was because I lived further away from most of my friends and usually had to drive over to them anyway. But part of it was because I loved being in full control of that big hunk of metal. 
										</p>
										<p>
											In college, I went to school in Santa Cruz, CA where there wouldn’t be much to do at night except destroy our livers and our lungs. Thus during those 4 years, I drove California State Route 17 A LOT more than others - to go back and forth between Santa Cruz and San Jose. The insanely windy roads were no joke - there would be an accident every other time I drove the 17 because people weren’t cautious enough. My very first time on that road, my friend Kenneth was sitting shotgun. I remember asking him, “So what do you think of my driving?” His reply was, “Uhm. Not bad I guess. I mean, you’re driving like 40mph while everyone else is going 60.” 
										</p>
										<p>
											Fast forward another year and I was hitting those turns at a bit faster than 40mph. I remember my roommate Brian would say, “It feels like the car is an extension of your body,” right after he stopped praying for his life. Like any other 20-year-old maniac, I eventually started timing my trips through the 17, thinking I was invincible. I remember my fastest time being 11 minutes and 30 seconds. I unfortunately have to admit I’m still proud of that.
										</p>
										<p>
											I could go on and on about the experiences I’ve had behind the wheel. The bottom line is that I love driving. Now at age 24, I’ve graduated college, am an adult, and am a much more responsible version of myself. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Just kidding, I don’t know a single friend who would believe that last statement entirely. A very responsible adult would appreciate the 2017 Honda Accord they had and drive it until it hit at least 250,000 miles. They would not sell it at 100,000 miles and buy a BMW. And they definitely would not buy a 2nd car after they had just bought the BMW 5 months ago.
										</p>
										<p>
											But the thing is, I don’t have to be a very responsible adult yet - I’m 24, not 42. I’m still 6 years from my 30s and 16 years from my 40s. 6 years ago, I was 18 and had no idea what my life would be like today. I can honestly say one of the few joys in my life that has stayed stagnant in the last 6 years has been my enjoyment of driving. To me, if you have something you enjoy THAT much, then pursuing it more deeply will pay more dividends to your quality of life than any mutual fund you could invest in.

												<h3>Wanting to do more</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												With that being said, the BMW has treated me very well so far. She drives great and looks amazing. Though, yes, what people say about BMWs can be true - they stand for Bring My Wallet. I knew what I was getting into when I bought it, and I did it anyway because I thought this would be a nice opportunity to learn how to do some car maintenance. Nothing big, but if I know the dealer will charge me $200 for an oil change on this thing - I’ll have the motivation to learn some stuff on my own.
											</p>
											<p>
												What I didn’t expect, was how much I would enjoy learning these new skills. It made me want to do more to my car. Although I’ve been lucky enough that no issues have arisen, it also meant that I’ve had no reason to pull out my tools. My next option was to start modding out my car, which didn’t seem like something for me at the moment. I actually don’t expect to keep this car forever - I plan to sell the it in about 5 years. Admittedly, this is a car for my 20s - in my 30s I’ll have a Lexus. Since I plan to sell the BMW in a few years, it’s best to leave it as close to stock as possible for better resell value.

												<h3>The stars aligned</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												After some pondering, I coincidentally received a message from my friend Tati, “Hey guess who’s getting a new whip??” This message was HUGE for me. Tati is a good friend from college and she drove a car that I rarely see anyone else drive. There have only been two people in my life who have driven this specific car model: Tati and my dad. When I became friends with Tati in 2020 and found out she drove this car, I immediately offered to buy it from her. Honestly, it was just a joke because I was still in college at the time and only had about $7 in my bank account. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Because it was just a joke, I never really brought it up to her again. So I was amazed that she remembered and asked me if I wanted to buy it since she couldn’t keep 2 cars. At first I laughed, but then after some more thinking - well I wouldn’t be writing this if I didn’t end up doing it right?
											</p>
											<p>
												When I went to meet up with Tati to check out the car, it was in much better condition than expected. The braking and acceleration were smooth, all the buttons worked, the seats were all fully intact, no rust whatsoever on the underbody, and it was all stock except for the radio she had in place of the cassette player she removed. The only noticeable damages were that the car would shake on idle, the paint was faded, and the right window didn’t work. Taking into account that the car had gone through 3 generations of use, I rated the overall condition of the car at a solid 6/10. Although for the price I bought it at, it was an 8/10.
											</p>
											<p>
												While test-driving the car, my friend Kenny sat shotgun while Tati sat behind the driver seat. During the drive, I noticed Tati’s mood was a bit off so I asked if everything was okay. A moment of silence passed and she admitted, “No I’m not okay. Steven I don’t want to sell this car. I’m only doing it because I have to.” That’s when I realized what this car meant to Tati. 
											</p>
											<p>
												There was a reason why she kept the car for as long as she did - she basically grew up in it. She told me about how her grandpa bought the car in 1995 and eventually passed it down to her dad, who eventually passed it down to her. Tati recalled a distinct memory of a road trip her family went on when she was 8 years old. She remembered sitting in the backseat behind the driver, the very seat she was sitting in while I was test-driving the car. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Later, I opened the glove box to see what was inside. Under all the car registrations that Tati had accumulated over the years, I saw a blank notebook along with an envelope with the words “car accident” written on it. Tati opened the envelope and showed me a piece of paper with written instructions on what to do in case the driver were to get in an accident. I thought it was something her dad wrote for her, but she explained that it was something her grandpa had written for her grandma back in the 90s. And the notebook was for her grandma to write down necessary information in case of an accident.
											</p>
											<p>
												Initially, I had my own personal reasons for wanting to buy the car. But after hearing Tati’s stories, I had a new reason. To her, I wasn’t buying something just for fun - I was essentially adopting her child. She wanted to sell me the car because it meant she would get to see it again.

												<h3>Dad Lore</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Before I was born, my dad had gone through 3 cars: Ford EXP, Toyota Celica, and Honda Prelude. He always told me the Honda Prelude was his favorite out of the three. Anyone who’s into JDM cars today knows my dad’s a G for having owed both a Celica and a Prelude back in the day. The Honda Prelude he had was the first car I was in when I was born. My dad told me it was the only car in our household until I was 2 months old and my parents decided it was time to get something more practical. That was when my dad officially gave up his 2-door coupe life and bought a Honda Odyssey.
											</p>
											<p>
												Although it wasn’t the car I grew up in, I still have fond memories of it. I remember poking around in it when I was 3 and accidentally putting the car in neutral, causing it to roll down the street. I also remember the time it was stolen for a week when I was 10. After the police found it, my dad would still drive it to work every day up until it gave out in 2014. I look back and feel that I missed out on some potential memories because I never knew how great of a car it was until I started becoming more interested a few years ago.
											</p>

												<h3>1995 Honda Prelude Si</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												The car I bought from Tati isn’t the exact generation my dad had back then. My dad had a 3rd gen Prelude with pop-up headlights, but after some research, I learned it’s nearly impossible to find parts for that generation these days. Today, the 5th gen Prelude is the most prominent generation on the street as it was the last generation of Preludes before Honda discontinued them in 2001. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Tati’s car is a 4th generation - which I think is amazing. The 4th gen prelude is not only more rare than the 5th gen, but it is also much easier to find parts for than the 3rd gen. I could go on and on about what makes this car so great, but that can be for another time.
											</p>
											<p>
												Tati had originally named the car Cherry because of its bright red color but hasn’t called it that in a while since the name sounds like one stripper would have. So in light of keeping the name of the car related to the color red, I’ve decided to call her Ruby. 
											</p>
											<p>
												I plan to try and restore Ruby to as close to 100% as possible, so this project will probably be a long one. If you’re interested in following my venture, I decided to make an Instagram account to document my journey <a href="https://www.instagram.com/prelude_1995?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==">@prelude_1995</a>.
